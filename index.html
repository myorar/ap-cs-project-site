      <h2>summer scratch project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/880744580">scratch.mit.edu/dariagame</a></p>
      <p>The goal of this game was to showcase what I had learned through my summer homework which I accomplished by making this catching game. I experimented with adding unique features such as shrinking and growing and drew some of my own graphics. By making this game, I learned how to code something so that the user will easily understand it.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project was to learn how to draw on scratch and experiment with allowing the user to input values. My partner and I went through a lot of trial and error until we discovered we could use mathematical formulas to code any shape. I learned how to run mathematical equations and create an accessible interface by creating this project.

      <h2>still life</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to sit in front of an arrangement and draw it free-handed. Throughout my process, I learned how to use chalk pastels and and let go of my control. This piece ended up winning best in show for my division at the Solano County Art Fair.

      <p>My Semester 1 genius hour was being an officer in Girls Who Code. As secretary, one of the things I did was create this website with all the information you need.

      <p>Wrote code in Wowki Simulator, then wired a neopixel to a Rapsberry Pi Pico. The goal was to create a stoplight that goes from red, to yellow, to green with rests in between.
